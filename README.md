Welcome to BusBuddy!
Here you will find the product of our blood, sweat, tears, and boba.
This is a glorious project, designed by the BusBuddy team to significantly reduce the carbon emissions produced by school busses, through the most optimized routes a computer can generate.
But not just that, we have also created a sleek and accesible interface for parents, admins, and students to access up-to-date information about their very own school bus!


Enjoyyy!!
:)
